# YQ-Player-nw.js-app-
A player for youtube videos using nw.js (node web-kit). Surely you wont like it, but it is of great use to me so :p ... You can paste or drop YouTube video url in the text box and click the '+' button to start a video to play. Adding further url will add them to the playlist. Click on the playlist item to play particular item. Click on the 'â˜¼' button to hide the video. 
... Enjoy :)
